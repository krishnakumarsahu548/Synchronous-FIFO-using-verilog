# Synchronous-FIFO-using-verilog
This project implements a **Synchronous FIFO** memory using Verilog/SystemVerilog. The FIFO is clocked by a single clock signal and uses standard read/write control logic. It is useful in buffering, communication, and data transfer between different blocks in digital systems.
